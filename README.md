## Description

This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md from a user's input.

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README with information about the app--what is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project.

This application will allow the user to generate a ReadMe file with alll the necessary headings.
